	<h1>Portfolio Website</h1>
	<p>My most recent project was creating this website.<br>
	I had found out about GitHub pages which I am able to host a website for free, while maintaining my Github knowledge.<br><br>
	I added one of the provided workflows on Github to this project to maintain the deployment of any changes to the website.<br>
		Creating this website has also allowed me to learn some HTML and CSS.
	<br><br>I've used Pycharm as the IDE for this project, I had started writing the HTML in notepad but quickly found out it is very time-consuming.</p>
