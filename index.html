			<td><p class="p">I am a recent graduate from the University of Huddersfield where I studied Computer Science with Games Programming<br>
			I chose this degree because it gave me a unique opportunity to work with students from different disciplines.
			<br><br>
			During my time at the University of Huddersfield, I was an academic rep for my course. In this role I would speak to students and find out if they had any problems with the course and I would relay this back to the course leader who would take action and improve based on this information.
			<br><br>
			When I'm not programming I can be found bouldering, bouldering, playing games or crocheting.</p></td>
